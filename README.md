# BATTLESHIP
## Project #3, Battleship - NR/AV

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
    - We approached Iteration 3 by utilizing the functionality checklist, and by splitting it up between player and game class. In addition, we assigned different parts of each class and created tests for them. We also used refactor notes along the way and was able to work on base functionality.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
    - We would give the game a bigger board, we would give more ships to place, we would give expand on the personality portion of the computer.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
    - Driver and Navigator, coaching feedback and async code reviews.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
    - Via (DTR)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y2E8uR-0PIXO_hKe1Tcdy3N7kTWDMo9l0OFeCnRUmys/edit?tab=t.0], group check-ins with Megan, multiple live sessions to review code together, and via Slack.
